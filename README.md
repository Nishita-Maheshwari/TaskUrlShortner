# TaskUrlShortner

# build this link shortener, I have used Java for back-end development with the Spring Boot framework and Mysql as the database. For front-end developmentwith Angular, we will create a UI where users can enter their desired URL.

Here is how we can build this link shortener step-by-step:

# 1. Set up the Database:

Firstly, we need to create a database in SQL database to storethe short URLs and their corresponding original URLs. We will create a collection called "url" and define two fields: "originalUrl" and "shortUrl". We will then establish a connection to the database from our Java Spring Boot application.

# 2. Create a REST API for generating short URLs:

We will create REST API endpoints in our Java Spring Boot application that receives the original URL entered by the user, generates a short URL for it, and saves the short URL and original URL in the MongoDB "url" collection.

# 3. Implement URL shortening algorithm:

We can use various algorithms to generate short URLs, but the easiest way is to convert the original URL into a unique alphanumeric string. We can use a Java UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to generate a unique string and then convert it to a shorter length using base-62 encoding technique.

# 4. Create an Angular Component for UI:

We will create a UI using React where users can enter their desired URL. When the user submits the form, we will call the REST API implemented in our Spring Boot application to generate the short URL and display it to the user.

# 5. Add validation for duplicate URLs and URL structure:

We will add validation for duplicate URLs before they are saved to the database. We can check if the original URL already exists in our "url" collection and return the already generated short URL for that URL. Additionally, we should validate the URL structure entered by the user to ensure it's a valid URL.

# 6. Implement a REST API for redirecting short URLs:

We will create a REST API endpoint in our Spring Boot application that receives the short URL entered by the user and redirects them to the corresponding original URL.

# 7. Implement URL redirection:

We will use a Spring Boot redirect mechanism to ensure the short URL entered by the user redirects them to the corresponding original URL.

That's it! This is how we can create a link shortener using Java Spring Boot,SQL,Angular.
